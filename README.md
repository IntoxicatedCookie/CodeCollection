# üç™ Cookie's Code Collection
In the first place, this repository was made to tidy things up for myself because I had a lot of archives sitting between my other repo's.
Second, since none of this will ever be updated, I thought it might come in useful for others. Even though this is poor code, you could use some of the code as a template, refactor it and customise it to your needs.
Think of it as a thrift shop for code, more or less...

### ‚ùóDisclaimer
This code is old, not optimised and written by a total noob at the time. For all I know, parts (if not all) of the code might even been broken in its current state upon trying to run it.
Therefore, it's probably **bad practice** for you to learn from this hot garbage.
Additionally, I will **not be looking at any pull requests** as I won't ever update any of the code anyway. It's an archive. I will, though, periodically push legacy projects to this repo (given I have any of course).

### ‚ÄºÔ∏è Another disclaimer
Regardless of the licence I have added to this repo, it's best you do some research yourself before you use any of the code in a public project or decide to publish your work.
All legacy projects are pushed to this repo as is and usually contain the appropriate licences, but this might not always be the case. Generally, you *should* be fine but don't take my word for it.

### üìû Contact
Got any questions or concerns? I will be publishing a website soon hopefully with all the information you need.
For now, feel free to reach out to me on Discord. My username is *intoxicatedcookie*, simple as that.
