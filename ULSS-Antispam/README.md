## Description
A few years ago a Discord server I held a staff position in got flooded by bots with mostly nitro and CSGO scams.
This was an attempt to make a bot which would detect and delete potential scam messages, it was targeting specific scams and not well optimised for universal use.

## Reason of retirement
As Discord's moderation features and security improved, the rate of scammers has drastically decreased and thus making this bot lose its purpose.
