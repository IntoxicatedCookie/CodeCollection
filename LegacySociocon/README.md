# LegacySociocon

## Tags
*javascript, php, npm, laravel, privacy, social-network*

## Description
Sociocon used to be a big project of mine, the goal was to own a privacy-focused social network which unfortunately didn't make it until release.
The project was too big to develop and maintain all by myself with the limited time that I had. 

## Reason of retirement
This project got retired in favor of the project "NextSociocon" which would be essentially the same, but entirely rebranded and with NextJS instead of Laravel at its core.
