<title>Privacy - Plugin Checker Documentation</title>
<h1>Privacy</h1>
<span>
    The application makes online requests to an API <code>(Plugin Checker Index / PCI)</code> which is also authored by me.<br><br>
    The service provider on which the API relies <code>(Vercel)</code>, <em>may</em> collect some data.<br>
    However, the API in itself does not collect any data.<br>
    <em>You can check Vercel's privacy policy <a href="https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</em><br><br>
    Furthermore, the Plugin Checker application in itself does not collect any data at all.<br>
    It only <b>stores</b> the obtained data from the API locally on your system.<br>
    This data is purely functional and solely related to GTA V / LSPDFR plugins. It gets stored until newer data is available, which will then replace the existing data.<br><br>
    <b>It does not involve the end user's personal data whatsoever.</b><br>
    <em>You can check for yourself in the %AppData%/Roaming/PluginChecker/cache directory.</em><br><br>
