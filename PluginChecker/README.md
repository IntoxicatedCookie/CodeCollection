# Plugin Checker

## Description
Plugin Checker acted as a small tool to simplify the management of mods for GTA 5. Users could analyse their GTA 5 log files and check for outdated plugins.
This tool is relatively stable and was tested by a small group of people, aiming for a public release at a later point which never happened.

## Reason of retirement
The development of the project was suspended in favour of BlazeBox, an online version of this tool with much more to be offered.
