# BackupManager

## Tags
*backups, data, cloud, csharp, winforms, mega*

## Description
BackupManager's purpose was simply to assist at creating backups of ZIP files. Backups got created and uploaded to my MEGA cloud automatically, taking out the hassle of doing it myself.
This was only useful for me because I used to use ZIP files as version control and to create backups of my projects. Cringe, right? 

## Reason of retirement
No longer a need to store backups in my MEGA cloud as I've found alternative options such as Github.
