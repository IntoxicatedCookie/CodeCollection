# SocioconStatus

## Description
This used to be a small side-project that I was creating for my major project called Sociocon. 
I used Cachet's statuspage system but since that broke and I couldn't install it properly anymore, this was my attempt to create my own basic statuspage system.
As you might have figured, it didn't last pretty long since I was barely halfway through the UI and almost no backend at all.

## Reason of retirement
This project got discontinued because of the retirement of its main project "Sociocon".
